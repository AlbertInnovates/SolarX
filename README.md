Solar energy is one of the most reliable renewable energy sources. While you have already worked on making solar panels, the next step is to integrate real-time monitoring and optimization using IoT, data analysis, and cloud computing. This will allow users to track energy usage and improve efficiency.
This project will develop a smart solar monitoring system that:
Uses IoT sensors to collect real-time data (voltage, current, power output, and temperature)


1. Processes and analyzes data using Python and C++
2. Sends data to a cloud-based platform for remote access
3. Provides a dashboard to visualize energy usage trends
